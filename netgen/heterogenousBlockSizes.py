    This function will generate heterogenous block sizes, following a powerlaw distribution.
    As in Clauset A, et al. SIAM Rev., 51(4), 661â€“703 2009.

    The transformation method is used to generate x samples from a powerlaw distribution.
    These samples will be the sizes of the blocks across each dimension, the functions is called
    for col and rows, separately.
    Two elements are needed: uniformly distributed random source r where 0 <= r < 1 and
    the functional inverse of the cumulative density function (CDF) of the power-law distribution

    The source r is simply given as a parameter to the CDF.

    the inputs are:

    N: int
        numnber of nodes to split into block
    B: number
        number of blocks on which the nodes will be divided
    x_min: int
        be the lower bound, i.e, minimum block size, default 10% of N
    alpha: float bounded in (x1,x2)
        be the scaling parameter of the distribution, default 2.5
    output:

    colsizes: list of ints
        a list containing B random numbers determining the size of each block
